    "classes": "Gwyn's average growth makes her a decent unit in any class. Devoted/Reaper line gives her good Might, Mastery and Luck for higher damage dealt with crits, as well as the highest total growth. Nightblade/Ancarant line gives her good speed for doubling, while also patches up her lower Fortitude stat. Seeker/Ellisant line gives her good Might, Mastery and Dexterity, which couples with the class's skills, result in accurate and powerful hits. Gallant/Champion line gives her the highest Might, Defense and HP, allowing her to hit really hard and take physical hits pretty well.",

On lower difficulties, this skill is powerful enough to make her virtually unkillable if you can keep up with the kills. Reaper is a decent choice for her in this case as it is a close range class with very high kill threshold, which is the best class to make use of her passive. On higher difficulties, Gwyn can use Ellisant as it has te range to damage enemies from a safe range. Her personal active skill can also add damage in addition to the bonus damage Seeker provides with Enchant Weapon. This skill is not going to be used often as game progresses, thus the upgrade are not of high priority. Reducing the mana cost is useful so that it is more readily available in case it is needed. Increasing mastery scaling will make this skill more powerful and find more use. Increasing mana cost for better effect is undesirable and the healing provided is niche but can be considered at lower difficulties when Gwyn is more likely to be tanking hits.",
    "gameplayBane": "Gwyn's personal active skill is rather mediocre. It is decent in the early game to secure a kill, but it provides little in addition to this utility. It is quite mana heavy for a simple skill and pales in comparison to Enchant Weapon from Seeker. Gwyn's stats, while not bad, also means that she excels in no particular area, which is a more prominent issue at higher difficulty when more min-max stats are preferred.",

Riordan's active skill is similiar to other Hunter classline units, being a normal attack with pet assistance, dealing extra damage with possibility of extra effect. Riordan has really good damage potential while having good defensive capability to take some hits as a Warden or Beastmaster. Upgrading the damage scaling part of his active skill allows for more damge to be dealt. Mana increase can be considered if going down Tamer/Beastmaster line but not desirable otherwise.

As a Warden, his Dexterity is lackluster and he might be missing more than you like. As a Beastmaster he has poor Speed, Dexterity and Luck, making his combat lackluster. As a Slayer Riordan's Might takes a hit and he deals less damage per hit while unable to double quite often.

Increasing Lunar Reave's range give Arthur a good way of nuking enemies from safe distance, while increasing mastery scaling pairs very well with Arthu's high Mas stat. As the game progresses however, Lunar Reave, while still really strong, will pale in comparison to even stronger skills Arthur has access to, like Warlock's Hellfire or Cosmician's Meteor, so its usage will drop. Cosmician Arthur's Meteor is an absolute nuke, while Warlock's Hellfire is a long range skill that can make Arthur into a skill-based sniper. It is recommended for Arthur to go down Geomancer first for great Mas growth, before reclassing into Warlock and promote into Cosmician, to give Hellfire te best scaling result.",

You can upgrade the mastery scaling if you have essence to spare but it is not necessary. Gameplaywise Cassandra can do well as a support with Waveseer/Tidecaller, healing teammates steadily. If you wish for a more offensive build, Waveseer for high speed growth before going into Ritualist/Hemomancer is a good option for Deity and lower difficulty, providing Cassandra with great Spd, power and crit.

He does have low Lck growth, which is a downside as it affects his crit chance. As Frigillan/Godfrost Saxon should have no problem tanking all Physical damages with his skyhigh HP and Def growth once Godfrost's Absolute Zero is active. However, his Frt will be quite low and his Spd will result in him getting doubled by most enemies, making Saxon vulerable to Magical enemies. Gale/Tempest is a mediocre line and Saxon's mediocre growth will not do well either. Conduit/Stormkeeper is another line Saxon can consider with the highest Mgt and Mas for Saxon. His defenses will be decent as Conduit/Stormkeeper's high Frt growth mod balances out Saxon's inherent good Def growth, but slow Spd and abysmal HP growth will still result in Saxon being unable to tank much hits.

Lowering the cost is the best upgrade so that the skill can still be considered as an after thought. Saxon's passive is an okay skill to increase Saxon's longevity and actually scales as the game progresses. However, it is pointless if Saxon decides to go into Ascendant as Divine Flow means Saxon is not going to take any damage in the first place.

The Poison stack upgrade is really good if you want to use Alden's skill, as even if Alden is not doing combat, it can support other units for easier kill. Range increase is a decent next choice to increase the number of situations this skill becomes useable. For class choices, Alden makes a good Aegis/Relic Knight for great bulk.

Valeria's passive is a decent increase to Valeria's usually subpar power, and its condition is synergetic with the dodge-tank default playstyle Valeria has. Valeria is one of the game's reliable dodge tank if she goes down the Nightblade/Ancarant line. She should be constantly using her skills to keep both the Dodge passives up.

HP and Mgt growth as passable, but Def, Frt and Mas growth are bad. Cutthroat does have a good skill in Licky Lasso, a skill capable of changing enemy position for easier kill. Tamer/Beastmaster will give Eve high HP and Mas growth and passable growth in all other areas, making Eve into a unit with no bad stats, but Eve will lose out on the ability to double most enemies. Quickdraw/Deadeye is a line that allows Eve to retain her Spd as well as having good Mgt, Dex and Lck, but her HP, Def and Frt growth are all really low.",
    "skills": ["Low", "Low", "Mid", "Low"],
    "gameplayBoon": "Eve's active skill is nothing spectacular, as due to her low Mas, it is not going to be effective at dealing extra damage or lowering enemy's Frt. Reducing cost is probably the best upgrade for it so that it might find more niche usage. Eve's passive is really good as it augments Eve's relatively low Mgt with her Acc, a stat EVe usually excel in due to her high Dex. Cutthroat/Slayer is the go to line due to its synergy with Eve in terms of growth, a very strong skill in Licky Lasso, as well as one of the best passive for Eve. Cutthroat's passive essentially increases Eve's Dodge by 1 for every point of Lck Eve has. As Eve has extremely high base Lck and growth, this passive makes Eve one of the strongest dodge tank in the game even on higher difficulty. Slayer's passive also provide extra chance for more damage as Eve doubles effectively with good crit chance due to high Lck. Slayer having access to 1~2 range is so good that it feels like an overkill. Quickdraw/Deadeye is a solid pick, but mostly outclassed by Cutthroat/Slayer. Tamer/Beastmaster provides another way to play Eve, focusing on her pet skills more, but is usually not favoured due to her poor Mas.",
    "gameplayBane": "Although Eve is one of the strongest unit in game, she is not without weakness. Her Mgt is lackluster most of the time, although it is not on Valeria's level. Ricochet from Slayer is good, but unreliable, so is her crit chance. It is very possible for Eve to not crit at crucial moments and miss a kill. Also, when compared to her dodge tank counterpart Valeria, the obvious disadvantage she has is her low Mas, resulting in Eve usually not using any skills other than Licky Lasso, and mainly as a combat unit instead of a versatile unit like Valeria.",
