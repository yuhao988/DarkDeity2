    "classes": "Gwyn's average growth makes her a decent unit in any class. Devoted/Reaper line gives her good Might, Mastery and Luck for higher damage dealt with crits, as well as the highest total growth.<br/> Nightblade/Ancarant line gives her good speed for doubling, while also patches up her lower Fortitude stat.<br/> Seeker/Ellisant line gives her good Might, Mastery and Dexterity, which couples with the class's skills, result in accurate and powerful hits.<br/> Gallant/Champion line gives her the highest Might, Defense and HP, allowing her to hit really hard and take physical hits pretty well.",
    "skills": ["Low", "Mid", "Mid", "Low"],
    "gameplayBoon": "Gwyn's personal passive gives Gwyn effectively up to 15 defenses on both side of the spectrum, making her even better at tanking. On lower difficulties, this skill is powerful enough to make her virtually unkillable if you can keep up with the kills. Reaper is a decent choice for her in this case as it is a close range class with very high kill threshold, which is the best class to make use of her passive.<br/> On higher difficulties, Gwyn can use Ellisant as it has the range to damage enemies from a safe distance. Her personal active skill can also add damage in addition to the bonus damage Seeker provides with Enchant Weapon. This skill is not going to be used often as game progresses, thus the upgrade are not of high priority. Reducing the mana cost is useful so that it is more readily available in case it is needed. Increasing mastery scaling will make this skill more powerful and find more use. Increasing mana cost for better effect is undesirable and the healing provided is niche but can be considered at lower difficulties when Gwyn is more likely to be tanking hits.",
    "gameplayBane": "Gwyn's personal active skill is rather mediocre. It is decent in the early game to secure a kill, but it provides little in addition to this utility. It is quite mana heavy for a simple skill and pales in comparison to Enchant Weapon from Seeker. Gwyn's stats, while not bad, also means that she excels in no particular area, which is a more prominent issue at higher difficulty when more min-max stats are preferred.",
    "Rings": "Gwyn is a versatile unit, but mostly focused on combat, thus combat related rings are the go to options for her. Bloodied ring works well on her regardless of the classline she chooses. Other choices are more class-dependent like crit boosting rings for Devoted/Reaper, or damage dependent ones for Gallant/Champion.",

His growth in Speed and Dexterity are low but the rest are all very decent. Riordan's total growth is very high and he can provide decent damage output in the early game as an archer.",
    "classes": "Riordan's high base growth results in him having really good growth rate in all the Hunter classline. He can be a decent tank with Ranger/Warden line with great HP, Might and Defense, and a respectable Fortitude.<br/> His growth in Tamer/Beastmaster line is similiar with only slightly lower Might and Defense, but even better Hp and good Fortitude, as well as much better Mastery. <br/>If you wish for a faster Riordan, Quickdraw/Deadeye is a decent combat option with good Might and Speed and passable bulk. Cutthroat/Slayer is similiar but with lower Might in exchange for a small increase in Fortitude, Mastery and Luck",

Just be careful not to let your weapon's weight reach 5 and the downside is mitigated. Riordan's active skill is similiar to other Hunter classline units, being a normal attack with pet assistance, dealing extra damage with possibility of extra effect. <br/>Riordan has really good damage potential while having good defensive capability to take some hits as a Warden or Beastmaster. Upgrading the damage scaling part of his active skill allows for more damge to be dealt. Mana increase can be considered if going down Tamer/Beastmaster line but not desirable otherwise. Mana cost reduction is unnecessary and increasing Defense reduction is not as useful as increasing Mastery scaling.",
    "gameplayBane": "Riordan's Speed is on the lower side and if you opt for Warden or Beastmaster he is going to be doubled by most enemies as game progresses. Even if he goes Slayer or Deadeye, he is unlikely to double quite a significant portion of enemies. He also have specific problems in specific classes. As a Warden, his Dexterity is lackluster and he might be missing more than you like. As a Beastmaster he has poor Speed, Dexterity and Luck, making his combat lackluster. As a Slayer Riordan's Might takes a hit and he deals less damage per hit while unable to double quite often. As a Deadeye he has no particular weakness but his Dex, Def, Frt and Lck are all not impressive.",

Aegis/Rlic Knigt line gives Arthur respectable bulk on both side but everything else are mediocre to bad. Finally, Scholar/Loremaster line has the best combat potential, having a great combination of Mgt, Spd and Mas, but Arthur's low Dex and Lck still locks him out of a competitive combat unit.",

Increasing Lunar Reave's range give Arthur a good way of nuking enemies from safe distance, while increasing mastery scaling pairs very well with Arthu's high Mas stat. As the game progresses however, Lunar Reave, while still really strong, will pale in comparison to even stronger skills Arthur has access to, like Warlock's Hellfire or Cosmician's Meteor, so its usage will drop. Cosmician Arthur's Meteor is an absolute nuke, while Warlock's Hellfire is a long range skill that can make Arthur into a skill-based sniper. It is recommended for Arthur to go down Geomancer first for great Mas growth, before reclassing into Warlock and promote into Cosmician, to give Hellfire te best scaling result.",

His Might is not terrible, but never great, and his Dex is not great either, resulting in less than stellar Accuracy.

He can go down the line before going into Cosmician again for a funny bulky Repulsor Shield build but is usually less reliable.",

You can upgrade the mastery scaling if you have essence to spare but it is not necessary.<br/> Gameplay-wise Cassandra can do well as a support with Waveseer/Tidecaller, healing teammates steadily. If you wish for a more offensive build, Waveseer for high speed growth before going into Ritualist/Hemomancer is a good option for Deity and lower difficulty, providing Cassandra with great Spd, power and crit.

His growth in Mgt, Def and Mas are quite good, but his Spd growth is mediocre, which means he will stop to double reliably as game progresses. His Dex, Lck and Frt growth are also really low. Saxon is a decent combatant throughout the game if you fix his weak areas accordingly.",
    "classes": "Saxon as Adept has access to the powerful Monk/Ascendant line, and he will do well in it with his great Mgt and Mas growth. His Spd is also decent and should reliably double most enemies with Monk's Charged Ki. His bulk is not too great but Ascendant's Divine Flow will make up for it. He does have low Lck growth, which is a downside as it affects his crit chance.<br/> As Frigillan/Godfrost Saxon should have no problem tanking all Physical damages with his skyhigh HP and Def growth once Godfrost's Absolute Zero is active. However, his Frt will be quite low and his Spd will result in him getting doubled by most enemies, making Saxon vulerable to Magical enemies.<br/> Gale/Tempest is a mediocre line and Saxon's mediocre growth will not do well either. Saxon may have good enough Spd to double many enemies, but he will struggle to kill with his barely doubling Spd and mediocre Lck and thus Crit.<br/> Conduit/Stormkeeper is another line Saxon can consider with the highest Mgt and Mas for Saxon. His defenses will be decent as Conduit/Stormkeeper's high Frt growth mod balances out Saxon's inherent good Def growth, but slow Spd and abysmal HP growth will still result in Saxon being unable to tank much hits. Saxon's inherent low Lck growth also will not work well with the classes wanting to get critical hits.",

It can be used early game to hit multiple enemies at once to clear out mobs on enemies easier, but it will struggle to get any kill. Increasing the mastery scaling is ineffective as the skill damage is limited by both the total cap as well as damage cap on individual enemies. Lowering the cost is the best upgrade so that the skill can still be considered as an after thought. Saxon's passive is an okay skill to increase Saxon's longevity and actually scales as the game progresses. However, it is pointless if Saxon decides to go into Ascendant as Divine Flow means Saxon is not going to take any damage in the first place. Monk/Ascendant is a powerful line, and Saxon is rather good in it. Conduit/Stormkeeper can also be considered.",

As Conduit/Stormkeeper Saxon's combat abiility is less than ideal due to his slow Spd and relatively low crit in a class hoping to reach 100% crit, but his ability to clear out multiple enemies, or to strike enemies from afar with Stormkeeper's Lightning Strike should not be overlooked.",
    "Rings": "If Saxon goes down the Monk/Ascendant line, he will be a combat focused unit, thus Bloodied ring is a good choice. Lava ring is also a considerable choice simply because Monk/Ascendant have powerful skills that would prefer a boost in skill num. <br/>If Saxon goes for Conduit/Stormkeeper, Radiance ring is a good choice as Saxon has multiple multi-target skills that can more effectively utilise this effect.

Combat capability is also going to be extremely poor.<br/> Geomancer/Cosmician line is a great line if Alden wants to increase his Mas, it also has decent bulk with good HP and Def growth, but its combat capability is terrible, making Alden a pure support once again.<br/> Warlock/Necromancer line has decent Mgt and Frt, but offers little in other areas.

The high Mgt growth also complements Valeria's passive, making her a great damage dealer.<br/> Devoted/Reaper offers the highest Lck growth for Valeria. It trades some Spd and Frt for more HP and Lck and small increase in all other areas, making it a decent option too.

If Benji goes Nightblade/Ancarant, while he becomes less susceptible to Magical damage, it also limits his damage output as he still will not double while having significantly lower Mgt, making this line not an optimal option too.

It is the only way to reliably farm Gold in this game and essential to keep on training missions forever once the main campiagn ends. Note that the skill will only give Gold if the enemy is killed AFTER the monkey attacks. So players can get gold if the monkey attack or the follow-up attack after pet attack kills, but not if the first attack before the monkey kills. Thus it is eesential to upgrade the Gold increase part of this skill. You can get the cost down upgrade if you are not going Beastmaster as the half cost from Beastmaster's passive makes this redundant. You can also go for Mastery scaling increase if the skill is not enough damage. Class-wise Tamer/Beastmaster is the optimal choice if you want to focus on her personal active, and Quickdraw/Deadeye for best combat potential. A mixture of Tamer/Deadeye is also possible to both retain the Spd from Quickdraw as well as pet damage boost from Tamer.",

As Quickdraw/Deadeye she should have little trouble doubling and heal out heavy damage, but she will not be able to kill with her personal as often to earn Gold, a problem she will also have as Cutthroat/Slayer. She will also be very vulnerable during enemy phase, as her inability to counter at 1 range may draw in many attackers.",

    "classes": "Vissarion starts in the Devoted clas, which naturally prigresses into the Reaper class. This line gives Vissarion extremely high Mas, as well as great HP, Mgt and Dex. His Lck and Def are also decent. His Spd is mediocre and with axe equipped he is unlikely to double, he will also have atrocious Frt. It is a good class as Vissasrion's high Mas will result in great Skill numbers, and decent Lck and Mgt will let him deal great damage by critical hits. Nightblade/Ancarant will offer the highest SPd for Vissarion, as well as great Dex and Mas, but being mediocre in most other areas, especially a shaky 35% growth in Mgt, makes it less than ideal for Vissarion. Seeker/Ellisant will give Vissarion best Mas growth, great HP, Mgt, Def and Dex growth, but terrible Spd, Frt and Lck. This is a good option for Vissarion too, as his high Mas will result in super long attack range for Ellisant's Full Draw. Finally, Gallant/Seeker gives Vissarion abusrdly high HP, great Mgt and Def, good Dex and Mas, but worse Spd, Frt and Lck than Ellisant. Vissarion can take physical attacks well, but his slow Spd and lack of good Skills to go with his high Skill number makes it not a great choice.",
    "skills": ["Low", "Mid", "High", "High"],
    "gameplayBoon": "Vissarion's passive is a decent boost to his defenses, giving Vissarion more survivability, but his magical bulk will still be shaky. His active skill is a great support skill in higher difficulty where the pressure for bulky tanks are much greater. Vissarion's high Mas usually allows this skill to give a pretty significant buff to allies, thus increasing duration and Mas scaling are great upgrade options. Classwise Reaper is a decent choice for Vissarion for long range sniping using Blink, similiar to Ellisant's Full Draw. Gallant/Reaper and Seeker/Ellisant are most ideal for Vissarion.",
    "gameplayBane": "Vissarion's Spd is more often than not lackluster, so he is proned to get doubled. Coupling with his low Frt, making fast Magical foes like Witches and Magi very dangerous for him. As a Reaper his less than ideal Lck stat may make him miss crucial crits, making him less reliable at doing his job. ",

    "introduction": "Calith is the last conventional unit to join your party. SHe joins in Chapter X of Irving Rescue arc as a Lv.X Geomancer",
    "base": "Calith's base focuses on Dec and Lck, with average HP, Mgt, Frt and slightly lower Spd, but terrible Def and Mas. Her growth rates are similiar with good growth in HP, Dex and Lck, average Mgt, Spd and Frt and lackluster Def and Mas.",
    "classes": "Calith's starting class is Geomancer, which naturally progresses into the Cosmician class. This line provides good Mas growth to patch up her low base Mas, gives Calith decent HP, Mgt, Dex and Lck, but mediocre defenses and bad Spd. Scholar/Loremaster line will give her average growth across the board but low Def and Frt and a mediocre HP growth. Warlock/Necromancer will give her good Mgt, Dex, Frt and decent Lck, but mediocre HP, low Spd, Def and Mas. Finally, Aegis/Relic Knight line will give her good HP, decent growth across the board except mediocre Spd and lackluster Mas.",
    "skills": ["Mid", "Low", "Mid", "Mid"],
    "gameplayBoon": "Calith's personal active skill is not very styrong as Blind is not a powerful debuff and Calith's Mas is low. It is mostly to combine with her passive to increase her defenses and make her a decent tank. Increasing the blind stacks by increasing the base number directly is more effective than any boost to the Mas scaling. Increasing number of targets also helps, but you may not run into so many situation of multiple enemies within range. If you wish to utilise her bulk as a tank you can go Aegis/Relic Knight line for some decent tanking. All other lines works fine for Calith too.",
    "gameplayBane": "Calith joins quite late into the game. By this point in time most of your team should already be optimised for gameplay and you do not need another member. Calith's skills and stats also are not very impressive to the point of outclassing your other teammates. Thus, it is not surprising for players not to find a good use for her. Still, she does not have much shortcomings except maybe her mediocre Spd and Mas, so you can still use her decently if you wish.",
