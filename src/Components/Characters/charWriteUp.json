    "classes": "Gwyn's average growth makes her a decent unit in any class. Devoted/Reaper line gives her good Might, Mastery and Luck for higher damage dealt with crits, as well as the highest total growth. Nightblade/Ancarant line gives her good speed for doubling, while also patches up her lower Fortitude stat. Seeker/Ellisant line gives her good Might, Mastery and Dexterity, which couples with the class's skills, result in accurate and powerful hits.

On lower difficulties, this skill is powerful enough to make her virtually unkillable if you can keep up with the kills. Reaper is a decent choice for her in this case as it is a close range class with very high kill threshold, which is the best class to make use of her passive. On higher difficulties, Gwyn can use Ellisant as it has te range to damage enemies from a safe range. Her personal active skill can also add damage in addition to the bonus damage Seeker provides with Enchant Weapon. This skill is not going to be used often as game progresses, thus the upgrade are not of high priority. Reducing the mana cost is useful so that it is more readily available in case it is needed. Increasing mastery scaling will make this skill more powerful and find more use. Increasing mana cost for better effect is undesirable and the healing provided is niche but can be considered at lower difficulties when Gwyn is more likely to be tanking hits.",
    "gameplayBane": "Gwyn's personal active skill is rather mediocre. It is decent in the early game to secure a kill, but it provides little in addition to this utility. It is quite mana heavy for a simple skill and pales in comparison to Enchant Weapon from Seeker. Gwyn's stats, while not bad, also means that she excels in no particular area, which is a more prominent issue at higher difficulty when more min-max stats are preferred.",

Riordan has really good damage potential while having good defensive capability to take some hits as a Warden or Beastmaster. Upgrading the damage scaling part of his active skill allows for more damge to be dealt. Mana increase can be considered if going down Tamer/Beastmaster line but not desirable otherwise.

As a Warden, his Dexterity is lackluster and he might be missing more than you like. As a Beastmaster he has poor Speed, Dexterity and Luck, making his combat lackluster.

Increasing Lunar Reave's range give Arthur a good way of nuking enemies from safe distance, while increasing mastery scaling pairs very well with Arthu's high Mas stat. As the game progresses however, Lunar Reave, while still really strong, will pale in comparison to even stronger skills Arthur has access to, like Warlock's Hellfire or Cosmician's Meteor, so its usage will drop. Cosmician Arthur's Meteor is an absolute nuke, while Warlock's Hellfire is a long range skill that can make Arthur into a skill-based sniper. It is recommended for Arthur to go down Geomancer first for great Mas growth, before reclassing into Warlock and promote into Cosmician, to give Hellfire te best scaling result.",

You can upgrade the mastery scaling if you have essence to spare but it is not necessary. Gameplaywise Cassandra can do well as a support with Waveseer/Tidecaller, healing teammates steadily. If you wish for a more offensive build, Waveseer for high speed growth before going into Ritualist/Hemomancer is a good option for Deity and lower difficulty, providing Cassandra with great Spd, power and crit.

As Frigillan/Godfrost Saxon should have no problem tanking all Physical damages with his skyhigh HP and Def growth once Godfrost's Absolute Zero is active.

Gale/Tempest is a mediocre line and Saxon's mediocre growth will not do well either. Conduit/Stormkeeper is another line Saxon can consider with the highest Mgt and Mas for Saxon. His defenses will be decent as Conduit/Stormkeeper's high Frt growth mod balances out Saxon's inherent good Def growth, but slow Spd and abysmal HP growth will still result in Saxon being unable to tank much hits.

Lowering the cost is the best upgrade so that the skill can still be considered as an after thought. Saxon's passive is an okay skill to increase Saxon's longevity and actually scales as the game progresses.

Valeria's passive is a decent increase to Valeria's usually subpar power, and its condition is synergetic with the dodge-tank default playstyle Valeria has. Valeria is one of the game's reliable dodge tank if she goes down the Nightblade/Ancarant line. She should be constantly using her skills to keep both the Dodge passives up.

In terms of growth, Eve similiarly has high Spd, Dex and Lck growth, subpar Mgt growth, and really low HP, Def, Frt and Mas growth. Eve will be a superb dodge tank with good crit potential, but she will not hit very hard if she did not crit and will have low Skill numbers.",
    "classes": "Eve begins in Cutthroat class, which naturally progresses into Slayer. This line has blistering fast Spd, as well as high Dex and Lck. HP and Mgt growth as passable, but Def, Frt and Mas growth are bad. Cutthroat does have a good skill in Licky Lasso, a skill capable of changing enemy position for easier kill. Tamer/Beastmaster will give Eve high HP and Mas growth and passable growth in all other areas, making Eve into a unit with no bad stats, but Eve will lose out on the ability to double most enemies. Quickdraw/Deadeye is a line that allows Eve to retain her Spd as well as having good Mgt, Dex and Lck, but her HP, Def and Frt growth are all really low.",
    "skills": ["Low", "Low", "Mid", "Low"],
    "gameplayBoon": "Eve's active skill is nothing spectacular, as due to her low Mas, it is not going to be effective at dealing extra damage or lowering enemy's Frt. Reducing cost is probably the best upgrade for it so that it might find more niche usage. Eve's passive is really good as it augments Eve's relatively low Mgt with her Acc, a stat EVe usually excel in due to her high Dex. Cutthroat/Slayer is the go to line due to its synergy with Eve in terms of growth, a very strong skill in Licky Lasso, as well as one of the best passive for Eve. Cutthroat's passive essentially increases Eve's Dodge by 1 for every point of Lck Eve has. As Eve has extremely high base Lck and growth, this passive makes Eve one of the strongest dodge tank in the game even on higher difficulty. Slayer's passive also provide extra chance for more damage as Eve doubles effectively with good crit chance due to high Lck. Slayer having access to 1~2 range is so good that it feels like an overkill. Quickdraw/Deadeye is a solid pick, but mostly outclassed by Cutthroat/Slayer. Tamer/Beastmaster provides another way to play Eve, focusing on her pet skills more, but is usually not favoured due to her poor Mas.",
    "gameplayBane": "Although Eve is one of the strongest unit in game, she is not without weakness. Her Mgt is lackluster most of the time, although it is not on Valeria's level. Ricochet from Slayer is good, but unreliable, so is her crit chance. It is very possible for Eve to not crit at crucial moments and miss a kill. Also, when compared to her dodge tank counterpart Valeria, the obvious disadvantage she has is her low Mas, resulting in Eve usually not using any skills other than Licky Lasso, and mainly as a combat unit instead of a versatile unit like Valeria.",

In terms of growth, Haoran has very good Mas growth, as well good Mgt and Dex. His defenses growth are also good. His HP and Spd growth are bad, and his Lck growth is especially atrocious at only 5%. Haoran will hit hard and have good Skill numbers, but his attacks will not crit nor is very accurate, and is prone to be doubled by the enemies.",
    "classes": "Haoran starts off in the Waveseer class, which naturally progresses into Tidecaller. This line provides decent Spd to compensate for Haoran's inherent low Spd. It also makes Haoran's Mas very high, making him a good support healer. Ritualist/Hemomancer gives Haoran best HP, as well as great Mgt and Mas, but its offensive prowess is heldback by the slow Spd and mediocre Lck. Elementalist/Spirit Keeper line gives Haoran best offense with high Mgt and Mas, but is held back by low HP, Spd and Lck. Finally, despite Haoran's inherent low HP, Juggernaut/Dreadnought line actually provides decent HP growth for him, and coupled with decent Def and Frt growth, makes Haoran a viable tank.",
    "skills": ["Low", "Mid", "High", "High"],
    "gameplayBoon": "Haoran's passive makes Haoran a great support unit, giving extra Mas to anyone healed by him. His active skill is arguably the best in the game, giving healing effect to a unit for up to 3 turns, which can stack up to 6 Mas using his passive. It is best to upgrade its duration for 3 stacks of his passive, but increasing range is also very helpful. Waveseer/Tidecaller have the most heals to make use of Haoran's passive, but will not really see combat. Elementalist/Spirit Keeper line wishes for amalgamation of skill and combat, wich fits Haoran's high Mgt high Mas stats.",
    "gameplayBane": "Haoran has low Spd and Lck, the prior hinders his ability to double, as well making Haoran prone to get doubled, resulting in undesirable outcome as Haoran has low HP. The latter prevents Haoran from reliably critting, which is detrimental if you go for Ritualist/Hemomancer. It is probably the safest for Haoran not to see combat, but it will means that his high Mgt goes to waste.",

In terms of growth, her strength and weakness are pretty much the same as her base stats, other than a mediocre HP growth. Mashal's combat will be great, hitting hard, fast and accurately, but will not be able to take magical hits or have high Skill numbers.",
    "classes": "Mashal starts off as a Gale, which naturally progresses into Tempest. This is the fastest line in Adept classline. When combined with Mashal's growth, this line gives her blistering fast Spd, good Dex and decent Mgt and Lck. She will also have ok Def and Mas. Her HP and Frt growth will be low. Frigillan/Godfrost gives her the best HP growth, coupled with great Mgt and Def, as well as decent Dex, but her Spd growth will be lowered and have more trouble doubling. Her other growths will also be atrocious. Conduit/Stormkeeper averages out most of her growth giving her decent to good growth in most area other than a great Mgt at 65% and an atrocious HP growth at 40%. Finally, Monk/Ascendant line gives her decent Mgt and Mas, good Spd and Dex, but terrible bulk and Lck. ",
    "skills": ["Mid", "Mid", "Low", "High"],
    "gameplayBoon": "Mashal's personal active skill is crucial in distinguishing her from her fellow Adept allies and her key to be a good Tempest. It grants her a huge boost to crit chance and a unique mechanic that depletes mana during combat, which can be utilised by other mechanics. Reducing the mana cost is very useful as it greatly boosts the longevity of the buff duration. Increasing the effectiveness are also decent choices, though bear in mind Mashal's Mas is not very high, so increasing base is usually more effective than improving scaling. Mashal's passive is decent but completely useless if she is not out-leveling her enemy. So make sure you use Mashal as your main party and level her up sufficiently. Mashal is great as a Tempest but instead of Gale she is better at Monk, with Charged Ki further boosting her Crit and other important combat areas. Monk/Ascedant is also a great line that Mashal can utilise. ",
    "gameplayBane": "While Mashal is fast and has a passive that further boosts Dodge, she is no dodge tank, at least not on the same level as Valeria or Eve. Her Def and HP are decent, but she cannot tank too many hits. If you go Tempest, be sure not to let her tank too many enemies at once. If you go Ascendant and utilises Divine Flow, make sure to keep a look out for your mana gauge and replenish for Flame Infusion if it deactivates.",

This makes Aya a glass cannon capable of hitting hard, fast and accurate, with decent Skill numbers, but extremely vulnerable if enemy even land just one hit on her.",
    "classes": "Aya starts off as a Warlock, which naturally progresses into Necromancer. This line gives Aya good Mgt and Dex, decent Frt and Lck, but mediocre Spd, HP and Mas, as well as atrocious Def. Geomancer/Cosmician trades some Mgt, Spd, Dex and Frt, for better HP, Def, Lck, and most importantly, much better Mas, a good choice if you wish to achieve high Skill numbers. Aegis/Relic Knight patches up Aya's poor bulk, but is generally pretty mediocre all around.

It is extremely good against heavy debuff maps and enemies, and essentially nullifying many of character death penalties. Her active skill complements this by giving her an active way to apply these effects onto herself, with the added benefits of cleansing these debuffs from allies. Reducing mana cost is the most important here as you can use this skill much more often. Scaling is good but less essential. Class wise Warlock/Necromancer and Geomancer/Cosmician each has its benefits, with Warlock having the almighty long range Hellfire and Cosmician has the much coveted boost to Mas. A common route is go Geomancer then Warlock before going into Cosmician. Aya will stack poison onto herself, never see combat and just fire off long-range Hellfire or absurdly powerful Meteor. A second option is to go in Scholar/Loremaster for the Spd to double, keeping Warlock for its Hellfire and make Aya a strong combat mage with good skills too.",
    "gameplayBane": "As said above Aya is a glass cannon and she absolutely cannot take a hit. She can stack her own active skill to reach 30 stacks of Poison, but this will disappear if she goes into combat. So it is crucial for poison-stacking Aya to never see combat. Combat Aya requires very specific ring and weapon set-up and will be very vulnerable if she cannot double her enemies.",

Tusk can tank physical damage well and a heavy hitter, but terrible magical bulk and skill number.",
    "classes": "Tusk comes as a Ranger, which naturally progresses into warden, the tank line of the Hunter classline.

Tusk's Frt growth is higher but still subpar, Spd and Lck growths are bad, but Mgt is still good. The main draw of this line is the high Mas growth Tusk can get, which couples with the line's passive, makes it the best line if Tusk wishes to capitalise on his Skill numbers. Cutthroat/Slayer growths balances out Tusk's growth, giving Tusk high Spd and decent Lck, while HP, Mgt and Dex remains high. This line will give Tusk very low Frt and Mas growth. Finally, Quickdraw/Deadeye line is a decent speedy alternative, with sightly higher Mgt, Spd and Def, still monstrously high HP and decent Mas.

It is a great damage option if Tusk goes down Tamer/Beastmaster line. Otherwise, it is a good option if Tusk is missing the kill threshold. Tusk's passive is very simple too: ignores weapon's weight to increase True Speed and Dodge. Tusk would love heavy weapons as well as runes that increases weight for other bonuses. Tusk is going to be surprisingly fast, although not on the level of Valeria, Eve or Mashal, but still good enough to double many enemies, if he goes down Quickdraw/Deadeye line.",

Low Mas is not an issue with Tamer/Beastmaster, but Tusk sacrifices Spd in that line. Otherwise, Tusk's skills usually have quite low numbers despite some having high scaling. As Quickdraw/Deadeye, Tusk has unreliable crit which is something the line does not want, and also may miss doubling threshold on some enemies. As a tank, Tusk is weak to magical damage so players need to be careful around mages.",

This line gives Laurai great Mgt and decently good Mas, as well as ok Spd and good Dex and Def. Her HP growth is the lowest in this line, but still a high growth of 70%. This is a decent growth for a line that focuses both on combat and Skills. Waveseer/Tidecaller is a more Skill focused support line that gives Laurai great HP, Spd and good Def and Mas, decent Mgt, Dex but subpar Frt and Lck. Thanks to Laurai's base, she actually still has decent combat and is a decent support option. Juggernaut/Dreadnought line gives Laurai great physical bulk and decent Mgt and Dex, but lackluster Spd and Frt will make Laurai quite vulnerable to magical attacks. Finally, Ritualist/Hemomancer gives Laurai an absurd 105% HP growth, as well as good Mgt, Spd, decent Dex, Mas and more prominently, decent Lck for more critical hits.

Increasing range should be the best upgrade in order to reach more allies. Laurai's default line of Elementalist/Spirit Keeper is a line that focuses on both Skill and combat, and Laurai is good at both areas. Her combat will boost her Skill numbers, and using Skill will boost her combat power.

However, do note that as Laurai is good at both combat and Skills, sometimes you will notice she is not so good in one of the areas if you focus on the other, and if you focus on both like Elementalist/Spirit Keeper, she cannot compare to the best out there in any one of the area.",

Frigillan/Godfrost as the tank line of Adept classline can patch up her physical bulk giving her good HP and Def, as well as great Mgt, Dex and Lck, but her Frt, Spd and Mas remains abysmal.

Gale/Tempest is an interesting option as Tal'Dera will have great Spd, Dex and Lck, as well as decent Mgt to be a good damage dealer, but she will be extremely fragile that can depend on dodge to survive. Finally, Monk/Ascedant is fantastic for Tal'Dera due to her innate high damag and crit chance. It also provided Tal'Dera decent Mas for better Skill.
