    "Name": "Devoted",
    "Rating": [4, 4, 0, 0, 2],
    "Stats": "Devoted is a class focusing on Mas and Lck, with high modifier and growth in these two areas. Other than Mas and Lck, Devoted also has decent mod and growth in Dex and mediocre numbers in Mgt and Spd. The defensive stats of Devoted are horrendous. Devoted is a class focusing on Skill numbers as well as Crt, with decent Ddg, but its Acc, TSpd and Pwr are low, and its bulk is absolutely terrible.",
    "Character": "Amongst the four units capable of going into the Devoted class, Vissarion starts off as a Devoted. He also has the highest total growth amongst them. He will have extremely high HP and Mas growth, good Dex and Def and decent Mgt and Lck. Benji as Devoted will have the highest Mgt and Lck, making him an excellent Crit damage dealer, it will also give him slightly better Dex and Mas growth. He will also have passable bulk, making him a good choice for Devoted. Valeria will have decent Spd growth and great Dex and Mas, but her stats in other areas will be mediocre. Gwyn as Devoted has good HP, Mas and Lck, ok bulk mainly due to high HP growth, and decent growths in other areas.",
    "Upgrade1": ["Mid", "Low", "Mid", "Mid"],
    "Upgrade2": ["High", "Low", "Low", "Mid"],
    "Skills": "Devoted's passive boosts unit's Crit chance if enemy is inflicted with a debuff. However, Devoted only can apply 1 kind of debuff on its own, and none of the Vanguard units have a personal skill that applies debuff either. So Devoted has to either be content with 1 stack of passive, go into a tier 3 class that provides debuffs, or relies on teammates help. Spinning Blade is a skill that boosts Devoted's bulk by quite a bit. While it is not very synergetic with Devoted's dodgy not bulky stats, it does have good numbers due to Devoted's high Mas. It provides a nice defensive boost in case Devoted need to face a counter attack. It also can serve as a debuff cleanser in higher difficulties when debuffs starts to hinder Devoted's combat capabilities. Hemorrage is the synergetic skill Devoted can use to boost Crit chance together with appling Bleed to enemey, further increasing damage outcome. It is recommended to go for the cost down upgrade in order to apply debuff more readily, giving Devoted higher Crit chances.",
    "Tips": "Devoted is a combat class with good Mas and crit chance. It also has some Block skill for extra bulk. You would like to stack some more Crit onto Devoted, as well as use items that boost damages. Devoted is not a bulky class, and its Dodge is also shaky, so players need to be careful with enemy phase tanking. Best use of Devoted is for attacking on player phase to deal Crit damage to enemies with weak Def hoping for a kill.",
    "Rings": "Rings providing extra critical are the best for Devoted: Dominator and Destiny ring are good. Rings that increases combat damage can also be considered.",
    "Weapons": "Axes and runes",
    "Class": "Devoted's natural progression is Reaper, a highly synergetic class as Reaper also focuses, if not more focused, on Critical chance and damage. Devoted's Crit chance boost would be useful if enemy is debuffed. Ancarant is a decent choice for Devoted to go into due to having a skill that can apply up to 2 debuffs to enemies, giving Devoted 3 stacks of its passive."

    "Name": "Nightblade",
    "Rating": [3, 3, 3, 0, 4],
    "Stats": "Nightblade is a Spd focused class with good Frt as well. The class has good stat modifier in Spd and Frt, as well as decent Dex and Lck, modest Mas, but terrible modifier in HP, Mgt and Def. In term of growth, Nightblade similiarly excels in Spd and Frt, and also sport a decent Mas growth. Dex growth is also decent but Lck growth is mediocre. The class's growth in HP, Mgt and and Def are poor.Overall the class excels in TSpd and Ddg, have decent Acc, Crt and ok Skill Num. Its Bulk and Pwr are atrocious.",
    "Character": "Amongst the four units capable of going into the Nightblade class, Valeria starts off as a Nightblade. She also has the highest Spd, Dex and Frt growth amongst them. Nightblade will bring out the stength and weakness of Valeria, making her one of the fastest unit in the game, a great dodge tank and magic enemy killer, with good Acc and Skill number, but bad physical bulk and very low damage dealt at base. Benji is the opposite of Nightblade, which makes Nightblade a great complement class for him if he wish to patch up his Spd, making him a good all-rounder combatant. Gwyn will have good Spd, Mas and Frt, stats that she may want to bring into her tier 3 class choice, similiar to Vissarion, but low HP and Mgt maybe a concern if they wishes to be a bulky unit or high damage dealer.",
    "Upgrade1": ["High", "High", "Low", "Mid"],
    "Upgrade2": ["Low", "Mid", "Mid", "Top"],
    "Skills": "Nightblade is a dodge tanking class, and its skills capitalise on this further. Nightblade's passive increases te class's Ddg even further if you use skills continuously, up to 40%, making enemy hit rate well below 40% with ease. The active skills complement this further. Grim Stroke applies Poison to enemy, decreasing their Acc further for even more \"Dodge\" on unit, as well as decreasing enemy's Def to boost Nightblade's otherwise lackluster damage output. On lower difficulties, it is better to decrease its mana cost to allow more uses of te skill as consective usage of skills is essential to keep up Nightblade's Ddg passive. On higher difficulties, it is useful to give it extra range as Nightblade can better support other damage dealers instead of having to deal low damage itself. Fleet Feet increases Spd of target, which also in turn increases Ddg. If the skill is applied to self, it is not uncommon for Nightblade to just receive 40 Ddg instantly off this skill alone. It is essential to get the self-cast buff for this. Increased duration is also decent way to keep up the Ddg just in case there is a break in skill usage. ",
    "Tips": "Nightblade is a good utitlity unit that is great in many areas. It is a great dodge tank in game, capable of doubling most enemies in combat. Nightblade may struggle to damage high Def enemies in higher difficulties but it does have Poison in its skillset to offset this problem. It has decent support potential too as it can debuff enemies or buff teammates or self effectively, making it useful in a lot of different situations.",
    "Rings": "Nightblade is a dodge-centric class, thus any Ddg increasing rings are appreciated. Depth and Diplomat rings are the first to come to mind, but Nightblade's low Mgt and thus kill power makes them less than ideal. Drunkard is a decent choice, as it provides good Ddg if Nightblade's skills are not active, and a decent failsave even if they are. Damage boosting rings are also great for boosting Nightblade's power. Advantage ring gets a special mention as Nightblade has great Spd and good Mas, good Mas means the ring is more effective, and good Spd means Nightblade can double and take advantage of the damage boost twice per round of combat.",
    "Weapons": "Daggers and runes",
    "Class": "Nightblade naturally progresses into Ancarant class, which is a good fit as Ancarant is also a dodge tank class, with passive that synergies really well with Nightblade's passive and active skills. Champion is not a great class, but Nightblade can provide the Spd growth for Champion to avoid getting doubled by the slower enemies, as well as more Frt for better bulk. Reaper and Ellisant do not particularly need Nightblade, but the extra Spd is always welcomed regardless."
