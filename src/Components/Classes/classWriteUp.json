Other than Mas and Lck, Devoted also has decent mod and growth in Dex and mediocre numbers in Mgt and Spd. The defensive stats of Devoted are horrendous. <br/>Devoted is a class focusing on Skill numbers as well as Crt, with decent Ddg, but its Acc, TSpd and Pwr are low, and its bulk is absolutely terrible.",
    "Character": "Amongst the four units capable of going into the Devoted class, Vissarion starts off as a Devoted. He also has the highest total growth amongst them. He will have extremely high HP and Mas growth, good Dex and Def and decent Mgt and Lck.<br/> Benji as Devoted will have the highest Mgt and Lck, making him an excellent Crit damage dealer, it will also give him slightly better Dex and Mas growth. He will also have passable bulk, making him a good choice for Devoted. <br/>Valeria will have decent Spd growth and great Dex and Mas, but her stats in other areas will be mediocre. <br/>Gwyn as Devoted has good HP, Mas and Lck, ok bulk mainly due to high HP growth, and decent growths in other areas.",

    "Skills": "Devoted's passive boosts unit's Crit chance if enemy is inflicted with a debuff. However, Devoted only can apply 1 kind of debuff on its own, and none of the Vanguard units have a personal skill that applies debuff either. So Devoted has to either be content with 1 stack of passive, go into a tier 3 class that provides debuffs, or relies on teammates help. Spinning Blade is a skill that boosts Devoted's bulk by quite a bit. While it is not very synergetic with Devoted's dodgy not bulky stats, it does have good numbers due to Devoted's high Mas. It provides a nice defensive boost in case Devoted need to face a counter attack. It also can serve as a debuff cleanser in higher difficulties when debuffs starts to hinder Devoted's combat capabilities. Hemorrage is the synergetic skill Devoted can use to boost Crit chance together with appling Bleed to enemey, further increasing damage outcome. It is recommended to go for the cost down upgrade in order to apply debuff more readily, giving Devoted higher Crit chances.",
    "Tips": "Devoted is a combat class with good Mas and crit chance. It also has some Block skill for extra bulk. You would like to stack some more Crit onto Devoted, as well as use items that boost damages.<br/> Devoted is not a bulky class, and its Dodge is also shaky, so players need to be careful with enemy phase tanking. Best use of Devoted is for attacking on player phase to deal Crit damage to enemies with weak Def hoping for a kill.",

Dex growth is also decent but Lck growth is mediocre. The class's growth in HP, Mgt and and Def are poor.<br/> Overall the class excels in TSpd and Ddg, have decent Acc, Crt and ok Skill Num. Its Bulk and Pwr are atrocious.",

    "Upgrade2": ["Low", "Mid", "Mid", "Top"],
    "Skills": "Nightblade is a dodge tank class, and its skills capitalise on this further. Nightblade's passive increases the class's Ddg further if you use skills continuously, up to 40%, making enemy hit rate well below 40% with ease. <br/>The active skills complement this even further, Grim Stroke applies Poison to enemy, decreasing their Acc further for even more \"Dodge\" on unit, as well as decreasing enemy's Def to boost Nightblade's otherwise lackluster damage output. On lower difficulties, it is better to decrease its mana cost to allow more uses of te skill as consective usage of skills is essential to keep up Nightblade's Ddg passive. On higher difficulties, it is useful to give it extra range as Nightblade can better support other damage dealers instead of having to deal the damage itself.<br/> Fleet Feet increases Spd of target, which also in turn increases Ddg. If the skill is applied to self, it is not uncommon for Nightblade to just receive 40 Ddg instantly off this skill alone. It is essential to get the self-cast buff for this. Increased duration is also decent way to keep up the Ddg just in case there is a break in skill usage. ",
    "Tips": "Nightblade is a good utitlity unit that is great in many areas. It is a great dodge tank in game, capable of doubling most enemies in combat. Nightblade may struggle to damage high Def enemies in higher difficulties but it does have Poison in its skillset to offset this problem. It has decent support potential too as it can debuff enemies or buff teammates or self effectively, making it useful in a lot of different situations.",
    "Rings": "Nightblade is a dodge-centric class, thus any Ddg increasing rings are appreciated. Depth and Diplomat rings are the first to come to mind, but Nightblade's low Mgt and thus kill power makes them less than ideal. Drunkard is a decent choice, as it provides good Ddg if Nightblade's skills are not active, and a decent failsave even if they are. Damage boosting rings are also great for boosting Nightblade's power. <br/>Advantage ring gets a special mention as Nightblade has great Spd and good Mas, good Mas means the ring is more effective, and good Spd means Nightblade can double and take advantage of the damage boost twice per round of combat.<br/> Charged ring is also an interesting choice as it provides more mana generation and can sustain Nightblade's skill usage longer.",
    "Weapons": "Daggers and runes",
    "Class": "Nightblade naturally progresses into Ancarant class, which is a good fit as Ancarant is also a dodge tank class, with passive that synergies really well with Nightblade's passive and active skills.<br/> Champion is not a great class, but Nightblade can provide the Spd growth for Champion to avoid getting doubled by the slower enemies, as well as more Frt for better bulk. <br/>Reaper and Ellisant do not particularly need Nightblade, but the extra Spd is always welcomed regardless."

Base on growth, Vissarion probably fits the most as he has the highest Mas and joint highest Dex and better Mgt than Valeria who also has the joint highest Dex growth. Vissarion also sports a good physical bulk for safer combat scenario although low Spd and Frt makes tanking not desirable. <br/>Benji will probably be the best damage dealer amongst the four as a Seeker with a balanced mix of Mgt, Dex, Mas and Lck, while Gwyn is decent overall with acceptable growth in all areas except maybe Spd.",

    "Skills": "Seeker's passive applies a debuff on enemy, making it easier for your teammates to kill that turn. It is handy and fits into Seeker's role as a chip damage dealer. <br/>Illuminate gives more Acc to self or teammates, a skill more inclined to higher difficulty settings where Acc at base are less reliable. Increasing duration is a nice boost as it turns Illuminate into a 25 cost 3 turn skill. Increasing range and allowing self-cast gives the skill more flexibility in Seeker's positioning. <br/>Enchant Weapon is the core skill for Seeker, providing a decent damage boost to the unit's own attacks. Casting it again before the effect from the first cast runs out will increase the duration further, but not further increasing the damage dealt. Increasing duration is better in terms of cost efficiency compared to cost reduction, but both can picked for maximum efficiency. If debuffs are an issue for you, clearing target debuff is a decent choice.",
    "Tips": "Seeker is a ranged class that cannot counter at 1 range, thus you need to position it carefully as Seeker can neither tank nor counter if attacked by enemies at melee range. Its skill duration can stack and will not exhaust if not entering combat so it is advisable to stack up damage boost during the waiting window before engaging the enemy. <br/>Seeker is best at chipping away enemy health before others can finish it off as it can deal good damage but cannot double, often unable to ORKO enemies, and can attack at 2 range to avoid counter of melee enemies.",
    "Rings": "Seeker would prefer some damage boost or skill number boost. Bloodied ring is a decent choice to boost Seeker's combat capability, providing not only Pwr but valuable TSpd and Crt boost, allowing Seeker to double some enemies in the early-mid game.<br/> Blazing ring is a nice option as the 50% damage boost it provides stacks multiplicatively with Enchanct Weapon.<br/> Mystic or Lava ring can also be used as enhancing the effect of Enchant Weapon can be very beneficial for Seeker.",
    "Weapons": "",
    "Class": "Seeker naturally progresses into Ellisant class. Ellisant allows unit to safely attack enemy from very long range, similiar to how Seeker can chip down enemies at a distance. Seeker's Enchant Weapon is also useful in giving Ellisant more damage.<br/> Other than Ellisant, Seeker can also provide useful damage boost to Ancarant or Reaper, but mana cost and class passives are less syerngetic than their natural counterparts."

His Spd is still bad but he does get respectable Mgt, Dex and Mas. <br/>Valeria becomes a more balanced unit in Gallant, having good Mgt and still decent Spd, good overall Bulk and decent Dex and Mas, but her Lck growth will be butchered completely.<br/> Gwyn makes a great combatant in Gallant too, having high HP, Mgt, Def and decent Dex and Mas.

It allows Gallant to have more OHKO potential, or simply deal more damage when it opens up a path amongst enemies. The condition is lenient enough and can still work even after enemies have been chipped. <br/>Call to Arms is the more useful skill for Gallant, providing a nice damage boost to all allies within range. Increasing its duration is very useful especially if you are not moving much for next turn, though just 1 more turn is usually good enough. <br/>Overpower is a weird skill as Gallant is a 1 range unit, pushing enemies away from Gallant seems counter-productive. It can be used to push allies butthe debuffs goes to waste. It can also be used to apply debuffs to enemies who cant be moved, but that is a waste too. Overall a weak and anti-synergetic skill not worthy most of the time.",
    "Tips": "Gallant is a physical powerhouse will good tanking potential on the physical side. Its skills and Skill numbers are all not great, and its low Spd and Frt makes it extremely vulnerable to Magical enemies. It is advisable to make Gallant avoid Magical enemies at all cost, unless Gallant can kill of said enemy before it counters. Gallant however, is good at deleting enemies with its high destructive Pwr and can take a few physical hits in return, so use Gallant to fend off otherwise dangerous Physical enemies.",

It is extremely powerful early game and secures Ranger as the best tank early game. It can even tank Magical attacks decently as Block will reduce Magical damage as well.<br/> Lanky Spanky does not have a Mas scaling to it, which is not a bad thing considering Ranger's low Mas. Stack increase is actually duration increase here, which can buy valuable time for your units to deal with threathening enemies. Stun in this game is not as mighty as other iterations as it does not stop the stunned unit from countering enemy attacks, but is still useful to stop them from attacking you during enemy phase.<br/> Command Orangutan is a standard Hunter class Red skill which is essentially a normal attack with an extra skill damage and effect attached. Exhaustion is just an ok debuff, but does help against dodgy enemies like Rogue, Witch or Sellsword. Mana cost down and increased stacks are all nice bonuses, but the healing is the more useful upgrade here, as Ranger is a tank unit with no healing outside of this. Healing will not only increase the longevity of Ranger, but can also bring Ranger above half HP threshold to potentially trigger its passive again.",
    "Tips": "Ranger is a tank class that can also deal good damage back. It is one of best tanks early game and can reliably ward off enemies when the situation arises. However, Ranger's effectiveness will start to decrease as the game progresses, earlier if difficulty is higher. This is due to its passive being static and its low Acc starts to catch up. Low Skill number also does not help as other units start to deal better damage with Skills.<br/> It is recommended to go into a tier 3 as soon as possible and use Ranger's skills as a support rather than stick to Ranger.",
    "Rings": "Ranger should focus on increasing its Bulk to tank better. Tranquility, Dauntless, Hollowed, Guardian, Indomitable and Dimming are all possible choices. Guardian is synergetic with Ranger's passive to give Ranger more Bulk when below half HP, and Dimming can remove Ranger's ineffective Mas stat to provide further boost to defenses, though due to Ranger's low Mas, the boost will be small.

It also has very high Crt with decent Acc, which can patch up its low Pwr dealing low damage per attack. Its only real weakness is its relatively low Skill Num, but it does not stop Cutthroat from being one of the best tier 2 classes.",

She also has low Mgt and Mas growth, which prevents her from being a perfect unit.<br/> Zanele is also quite fast as a Cutthroat, and slightly better growth in most other areas compared to Eve other than HP, most notable is her high Mas growth which Eve lacks. However, Zanele does suffer from a low Lck growth, which is anti-synergetic with Cutthroat's passive, making her not as compatible with the class compared to Eve. <br/>Tusk can be quite a fast and strong combatant as a Cutthroat, with his passive essentially providing more Spd. His Ddg is nowhere near as impressive as Eve's but with his monstrous HP and better Def it is not a bad combination. <br/>Lastly, Riordan has the best total growth, but will have a more balanced spread across the board.

You may use this skill to drag in bosses from far away towards you and end the chapter much earlier. Increasing range is the best option as it is unlikely to increase much otherwise due to Cutthroat's relatively low Mas.<br /> Command Toad is a more standard Hunter class Red skill that often gets overlooked in favour of Lick Lasso. It offers Poison debuff, the strongest type of debuff in the game, which can boost Cutthroat's relative lower damage instance. Increasing the number of stacks is very effective due to how Poison works in this game. Healing is unnecessary as Cutthroat as a dodge tank seldom takes any damage.",
    "Tips": "Cutthroat is a dodge tank, possibly the better form of tanker in this game compared to bulky tankers. Cutthroat is thus great in the front line and unlike Nightblade, deals better damage due to much higher Crt potential. You do need to look out for enemies with Precision and Trueseeing, they can be quite dangerous as Cutthroat's bulk without Ddg is very low. Otherwise, you can usually throw a good Cuthroat into a crowd of enemies without much worry.",
    "Rings": "Rings providing extra Ddg is good for Cutthroat: Depth and Diplomat rings are recommended. Drunkard is okay but less recommended due to innate high Ddg of Cutthroat diminishing its effectiveness.<br/>Cutthroat can also take advantage of Farseer ring as Licky Lasso has 2 range increasing upgrades, essentially gaining +4 Range with Farseer ring and upgrades.",

Slayer is a great 1-2 range class and has a passive to boost damage output, one thing Cutthroat lacks, making Cutthroat/Slayer one of the best in the game. <br/>Deadeye is also a great choice as it is also a fast class with decent Lck. Deadeye also has better Mgt and Mas, making Cutthroat/Deadeye is clas with both good Pwr and Ddg.

Its cost is expensive and only last 1 attack per unit. It is usually used as an emergency measure rather than common use. Decreasing its cost or increasing total stacks given is usually prefered. <br/>Command Lion is a Red skill and boosted by Tamer's passive, essentially making it 125% Mas scaling before upgrade. Unlike most other Pet Commands, this one has no secondary effects and instead have high Mas scaling, something Tamer likes.

It can help to support teammates if there are numerous enemies that player cannot take out in one turn but it is highly situational.<br/>Command Hyena is your typical Hunter Red Skill that deals extra damage in addition to a normal attack and applies a Bleed debuff, adding even more damage to it. It is essentially just more damage, something welcomed by a damage-centric class. Adding a heal for some utility or increase stacks for more damage is preferred.",
    "Tips": "Quickdraw is a combat focused class, with good damage, fast speed for doubling and accurate attacks. Players should focus on Spd for doubling as it will trigger the class's passive. While Quickdraw's Skill num is not very good, as Hunter's skills are based off a normal attack, players can still expect good damage output. As Quickdraw has a way to refill Mana, players should not hesitate to use skills whenever necessary.",
    "Rings": "Quickdraw would prefer rings that improves battle performances. Grip increase TSpd equals to half of weapon weight, which might be useful if you opt for heavy weapons. Kindling increases Pwr every time mana is spent, which can be useful to combo with Quickdraw's mana regen for more Skill usage.<br/> Crit increasing rings are also great due to Quickdraw's high Mgt and Spd, so Soulfire and Dominator can be considered. <br/>Finally, Archmage is an interesting pick as Quickdraw is a 2 range unit and its skills depend on attack range, which means it qualifies for the condition needed to trigger Archmage ring's effect, essentially giving Quickdraw 1 extra attack range.",
    "Weapons": "",
    "Class": "Quickdraw naturally progresses into the Deadeye class, with similiar stas and growths. It is also a good combat class and plays quite well. <br/>Slayer is a decent choice which is also fast, and has 1-2 range, which utilises Quickdraw's passive much better than Quickdraw itself or Deadeye, making it a great choice too.<br/>Warden and Beastmaster are too slow to utilise Quickdraw's passive, and Quickeye does not really have strong skill effects, and the classes would much rather have Cutthroat for better Spd growth."

In terms of growth, Geomancer has great HP and Mas growth, decent Mgt, Def and Lck growth and low growth in terms of Spd, Dex and Frt.<br/> Geomancer is a Skill focused class with great Skill Num and decent Bulk, but lackluster in terms of combat with below average Pwr, Ddg, TSpd and Acc. It does however, has decent Crt potential.",
    "Character": "Amongst the four units capable of going into the Geomancer class, Calith starts off as a Geomancer. She has the highest Dex and Lck growth amongst all. She has good HP and Lck, but all her other growths are mostly mediocre, making her not so good interms of either combat or Skill num. <br/> Athur has the highest Mas growth and can get insanely high Mas for extremely powerful skills. He also will get good Mgt and decent Bulk, making his combat performance more tolerable. <br/> Alden will have high HP growth, good Def and Mas growth and decent Mgt and Frt. He will be a bulky unit with good Skill num. <br/> Finally, Aya will be more min-mix with good Mgt, Mas and Lck, decent HP, Dex and Def but mediocre Spd and poor Frt.",

    "Skills": "Geomancer's passive is a slight buff to teammates. If more than 2 allies are within range, 2 will be buffed at random. The skill is nice to have in the early game but even then it is not strong. It quickly becomes quite irrelevant and not something players usually pay attention to due to the buff provided being too small. <br/> Starsurge is similiar to Rescue from Fire Emblem series but can also deal damage to enemies adjacent to target. The Rescue part is highly useful to get allies move long distance, but the damage is situational. Cost down to allow more usage is highly preferred, and range increase is very useful early game when Mas is still low. Caster healing is not recommended as it is rarely used to deal damage.<br/>Moonlight works similiar to Physics in Fire Emblem, and can heal allies from distance, making it an extremely useful healing option. Geomancer with its high Mas can usually heal allies from very far away. Range increase is useful early on and can be replaced later if seems redundant. Player can choose debuff removal if debuffs are prevalent, or give mana to target for better support.",
    "Tips": "Geomancer is a class focusing on good Skill numbers. Not only does it have good skill growth, but also good skill effects, though the effects are supportive and usually not offensive. If player wants good skill numbers later for their units, they can consider levelling up in Geomancer first. Geomancer should not usually be used for combat and should only be used sparingly and avoid enemy phase combat.",
    "Rings": "Geomancer is a skill focused class, and thus would appreciate skill bosting rings such as Mystic and Lava rings. Skill range increasing effects such as Archmage and Farseer ring are also great. <br/> Heir ring is also a good match as Geomancer has good HP and boosting Mastery is greatly appreciated.<br/>If player wish to make Geomancer a more combat focused class, Surefire, Advantage and Bloodied ring are possible options, all of which utilises the class's good HP or Mas to boost combat performances.",
    "Weapons": "",
    "Class": "Geomancer naturally progress in to Cosmician, a class that offers one of the highest Mas growth in game, as well as passive that gives extra Mas, which can significantly boost the effects of Geomancer's skills. A perfect upgrade for Geomancer. <br/> Other tier 3 classes does not offer much to Geomancer, but will appreciate Geomancer's high Mas growth to boost their own Skill num.   "
