    "Stats": "Devoted is a class focusing on Mas and Lck, with high modifier and growth in these two areas. Other than Mas and Lck, Devoted also has decent mod and growth in Dex and mediocre numbers in Mgt and Spd. The defensive stats of Devoted are horrendous. Devoted is a class focusing on Skill numbers as well as Crt, with decent Ddg, but its Acc, TSpd and Pwr are low, and its bulk is absolutely terrible.",
    "Character": "Amongst the four units capable of going into the Devoted class, Vissarion starts off as a Devoted. He also has the highest total growth amongst them. He will have extremely high HP and Mas growth, good Dex and Def and decent Mgt and Lck. Benji as Devoted will have the highest Mgt and Lck, making him an excellent Crit damage dealer, it will also give him slightly better Dex and Mas growth. He will also have passable bulk, making him a good choice for Devoted. Valeria will have decent Spd growth and great Dex and Mas, but her stats in other areas will be mediocre. Gwyn as Devoted has good HP, Mas and Lck, ok bulk mainly due to high HP growth, and decent growths in other areas.",

    "Upgrade2": ["High", "Low", "Low", "Mid"],
    "Skills": "Devoted's passive boosts unit's Crit chance if enemy is inflicted with a debuff. However, Devoted only can apply 1 kind of debuff on its own, and none of the Vanguard units have a personal skill that applies debuff either. So Devoted has to either be content with 1 stack of passive, go into a tier 3 class that provides debuffs, or relies on teammates help. Spinning Blade is a skill that boosts Devoted's bulk by quite a bit. While it is not very synergetic with Devoted's dodgy not bulky stats, it does have good numbers due to Devoted's high Mas. It provides a nice defensive boost in case Devoted need to face a counter attack. It also can serve as a debuff cleanser in higher difficulties when debuffs starts to hinder Devoted's combat capabilities. Hemorrage is the synergetic skill Devoted can use to boost Crit chance together with appling Bleed to enemey, further increasing damage outcome. It is recommended to go for the cost down upgrade in order to apply debuff more readily, giving Devoted higher Crit chances.",
    "Tips": "Devoted is a combat class with good Mas and crit chance. It also has some Block skill for extra bulk. You would like to stack some more Crit onto Devoted, as well as use items that boost damages. Devoted is not a bulky class, and its Dodge is also shaky, so players need to be careful with enemy phase tanking. Best use of Devoted is for attacking on player phase to deal Crit damage to enemies with weak Def hoping for a kill.",
    "Rings": "Rings providing extra critical are the best for Devoted: Dominator and Destiny ring are good. Rings that increases combat damage can also be considered.",
    "Weapons": "Axes and runes",
    "Class": "Devoted's natural progression is Reaper, a highly synergetic class as Reaper also focuses, if not more focused, on Critical chance and damage. Devoted's Crit chance boost would be useful if enemy is debuffed. Ancarant is a decent choice for Devoted to go into due to having a skill that can apply up to 2 debuffs to enemies, giving Devoted 3 stacks of its passive."

The class has good stat modifier in Spd and Frt, as well as decent Dex and Lck, modest Mas, but terrible modifier in HP, Mgt and Def. In term of growth, Nightblade similiarly excels in Spd and Frt, and also sport a decent Mas growth. Dex growth is also decent but Lck growth is mediocre. The class's growth in HP, Mgt and and Def are poor.Overall the class excels in TSpd and Ddg, have decent Acc, Crt and ok Skill Num. Its Bulk and Pwr are atrocious.",
    "Character": "Amongst the four units capable of going into the Nightblade class, Valeria starts off as a Nightblade. She also has the highest Spd, Dex and Frt growth amongst them. Nightblade will bring out the stength and weakness of Valeria, making her one of the fastest unit in the game, a great dodge tank and magic enemy killer, with good Acc and Skill number, but bad physical bulk and very low damage dealt at base. Benji is the opposite of Nightblade, which makes Nightblade a great complement class for him if he wish to patch up his Spd, making him a good all-rounder combatant. Gwyn will have good Spd, Mas and Frt, stats that she may want to bring into her tier 3 class choice, similiar to Vissarion, but low HP and Mgt maybe a concern if they wishes to be a bulky unit or high damage dealer.",
    "Upgrade1": ["High", "High", "Low", "Mid"],
    "Upgrade2": ["Low", "Mid", "Mid", "Top"],
    "Skills": "Nightblade is a dodge tanking class, and its skills capitalise on this further. Nightblade's passive increases te class's Ddg even further if you use skills continuously, up to 40%, making enemy hit rate well below 40% with ease. The active skills complement this further. Grim Stroke applies Poison to enemy, decreasing their Acc further for even more \"Dodge\" on unit, as well as decreasing enemy's Def to boost Nightblade's otherwise lackluster damage output. On lower difficulties, it is better to decrease its mana cost to allow more uses of te skill as consective usage of skills is essential to keep up Nightblade's Ddg passive. On higher difficulties, it is useful to give it extra range as Nightblade can better support other damage dealers instead of having to deal low damage itself. Fleet Feet increases Spd of target, which also in turn increases Ddg. If the skill is applied to self, it is not uncommon for Nightblade to just receive 40 Ddg instantly off this skill alone. It is essential to get the self-cast buff for this. Increased duration is also decent way to keep up the Ddg just in case there is a break in skill usage. ",
    "Tips": "Nightblade is a good utitlity unit that is great in many areas. It is a great dodge tank in game, capable of doubling most enemies in combat. Nightblade may struggle to damage high Def enemies in higher difficulties but it does have Poison in its skillset to offset this problem. It has decent support potential too as it can debuff enemies or buff teammates or self effectively, making it useful in a lot of different situations.",
    "Rings": "Nightblade is a dodge-centric class, thus any Ddg increasing rings are appreciated. Depth and Diplomat rings are the first to come to mind, but Nightblade's low Mgt and thus kill power makes them less than ideal. Drunkard is a decent choice, as it provides good Ddg if Nightblade's skills are not active, and a decent failsave even if they are. Damage boosting rings are also great for boosting Nightblade's power. Advantage ring gets a special mention as Nightblade has great Spd and good Mas, good Mas means the ring is more effective, and good Spd means Nightblade can double and take advantage of the damage boost twice per round of combat. Charged ring is also an interesting choice as it provides more mana generation and can sustain Nightblade's skill usage longer.",
    "Weapons": "Daggers and runes",
    "Class": "Nightblade naturally progresses into Ancarant class, which is a good fit as Ancarant is also a dodge tank class, with passive that synergies really well with Nightblade's passive and active skills. Champion is not a great class, but Nightblade can provide the Spd growth for Champion to avoid getting doubled by the slower enemies, as well as more Frt for better bulk. Reaper and Ellisant do not particularly need Nightblade, but the extra Spd is always welcomed regardless."

Its growth are similiar with a focus on great Mgt, Dex and Mas, a surprisingly decent Def growth, subpar HP, Frt and Lck growth, and lastly a bad Spd growth. Seeker focuses on having good Skill Number and Acc, with above average Pwr and slightly below average bulk. It can convert SKill Numbers into Pwr but have poor TSpd, Ddg and Crt.",
    "Character": "None of the characters you have starts off in this class. Base on growth, Vissarion probably fits the most as he has the highest Mas and joint highest Dex and better Mgt than Valeria who also has the joint highest Dex growth. Vissarion also sports a good physical bulk for safer combat scenario although low Spd and Frt makes tanking not desirable. Benji will probably be the best damage dealer amongst the four as a Seeker with a balanced mix of Mgt, Dex, Mas and Lck, while Gwyn is decent overall with acceptable growth in all areas except maybe Spd.",
    "Upgrade1": ["Mid", "Mid", "Mid", "Low"],
    "Upgrade2": ["Mid", "Low", "High", "Mid"],
    "Skills": "Seeker's passive applies a debuff on enemy, making it easier for your teammates to kill that turn. It is handy and fits into Seeker's role as a chip damage dealer. Illuminate gives more Acc to self or teammates, a skill more inclined to higher difficulty settings where Acc at base are less reliable. Increasing duration is a nice boost as it turns Illuminate into a 25 cost 3 turn skill. Increasing range and allowing self-cast gives the skill more flexibility in Seeker's positioning. Enchant Weapon is the core skill for Seeker, providing a decent damage boost to the unit's own attacks. Casting it again before the effect from the first cast runs out will increase the duration further, but not further increasing the damage dealt. Increasing duration is better in terms of cost efficiency compared to cost reduction, but both can picked for maximum efficiency. If debuffs are an issue for you, clearing target debuff is a decent choice.",
    "Tips": "Seeker is a ranged class that cannot counter at 1 range, thus you need to position it carefully as Seeker can neither tank nor counter if attacked by enemies at melee range. Its skill duration can stack and will not exhaust if not entering combat so it is advisable to stack up damage boost during the waiting window before engaging the enemy. Seeker is best at chipping away enemy health before others can finish it off as it can deal good damage but cannot double, often unable to ORKO enemies, and can att at 2 range to avoid counter of melee enemies.",
    "Rings": "Seeker would prefer some damage boost or skill number boost. Bloodied ring is a decent choice to boost Seeker's combat capability, providing not only Pwr but valuable TSpd and Crt boost, allowing Seeker to double some enemies in the early-mid game. Blazing ring is a nice option as the 50% damage boost it provides stacks multiplicatively with Enchanct Weapon. Mystic or Lava ring can also be used as enhancing the effect of Enchant Weapon can be very beneficial for Seeker.",
    "Weapons": "",
    "Class": "Seeker naturally progresses into Ellisant class. Ellisant allows unit to safely attack enemy from very long range, similiar to how Seeker can chip down enemies at a distance. Seeker's Enchant Weapon is also useful in giving Ellisant more damage. Other than Ellisant, Seeker can also provide useful damage boost to Ancarant or Reaper, but mana cost and class passives are less syerngetic than their natural counterparts."

In terms of growth, Gallant focuses on HP, Mgt and Def, with decent Dex and moderate Mas. Its growth in terms of Spd, Frt and Lck are abysmal. Gallant is a class focusing on physical Bulk and raw Pwr. Its performance in terms of Skill Num, Acc, Ddg and Crt are all well below average.",
    "Character": "All four characters that have access to Gallant class will have absurdly high HP growth. Benji starts off naturally in this class, and has highest Mgt and joint highest Def growth. It is a min-max class that sacrifices Spd and Mas, as well as very mediocre Dex, Frt and Lck, for HP, Mgt and Def. Vissarion with his personal growth is even more min-max, with much better physical bulk, but even lower Frt and Lck. His Spd is still bad but he does get respectable Mgt, Dex and Mas. Valeria becomes a more balanced unit in Gallant, having good Mgt and still decent Spd, good overall Bulk and decent Dex and Mas, but her Lck growth will be butchered completely. Gwyn makes a great combatant in Gallant too, having high HP, Mgt, Def and decent Dex and Mas. Nothing is too terrible about Gallant Gwyn except slightly subpar Spd, Frt and Lck. ",
    "Upgrade1": ["High", "Mid", "High", "Low"],
    "Upgrade2": ["Low", "Mid", "Low", "Low"],
    "Skills": "Gallant's passive is a decent damage boost against enemies at full HP. It allows Gallant to have more OHKO potential, or simply deal more damage when it opens up a path amongst enemies. The condition is lenient enough and can still work even after enemies have been chipped. Call to Arms is the more useful skill for Gallant, providing a nice damage boost to all allies within range. Increasing its duration is very useful especially if you are not moving much for next turn, though just 1 more turn is usually good enough. Overpower is a weird skill as Gallant is a 1 range unit, pushing enemies away from Gallant seems counter-productive. It can be used to push allies butthe debuffs goes to waste. It can also be used to apply debuffs to enemies who cant be moved, but that is a waste too. Overall a weak and anti-synergetic skill not worthy most of the time.",
    "Tips": "Gallant is a physical powerhouse will good tanking potential on the physical side. Its skills and Skill numbers are all not great, and its low Spd and Frt makes it extremely vulnerable to Magical enemies. It is advisable to make Gallant avoid Magical enemies at all cost, unless Gallant can kill of said enemy before it counters. Gallant however, is good at deleting enemies with its high destructive Pwr and can take a few physical hits in return, so use Gallant to fend off otherwise dangerous Physical enemies.",
    "Rings": "Bloodied ring is always a good choice for combat focused class, not an exception for Gallant. Blazing ring will also stack with Gallant's passive and Call to Arms, making it a decent choice. Tranquility, Dauntless, Guardian, Indomitable and Dimming are all possible options if you wish to boost the bulk of Gallant. Equilibrium is also an option if you find Gallant's low Frt a crippling issue.",
    "Weapons": "",
    "Class": "Gallant naturally progresses into Champion class, a class that also focuses on raw Pwr and combat damage. It is a good fit for Gallant. However, Gallant also would do well going into Reaper, as Reaper's passive condition conincides with Gallant's and can result in good damage."

Ranger is the tank class of Hunter classline, focusing on Bulk and Pwr. Its TSpd and Ddg surprisingly decent for a tank but its Skill num is absolutely atrocious, it is the worst class in terms of Mas in the entire game.",
    "Character": "Amongst the four units capable of going into the Ranger class, Tusk starts off as a Ranger. He has monstrous HP growth as Ranger, as well as great Mgt and Def. His other stats are mediocre, and Frt and Mas growth are atrocious, a typical tank build. Zanele will have decent bulk as Ranger, having good Mgt too. However it is not recommended as her personal skill will be rendered much less effective due to low Mas. Eve is also not recommended as a Ranger as while her bulk and Mgt are decent, her Spd will take a hit making her double less enemies. Riordan has great bulk and Mgt too as a Ranger, and have decent Mas and Lck too. His Spd and Dex will become an issue but if looking pass those Riordan will make a great Ranger.",
    "Upgrade1": ["Low", "Low", "Mid", "High"],
    "Upgrade2": ["Mid", "Mid", "Mid", "Top"],
    "Skills": "Ranger's passive gives itself more Bulk when it falls below half HP, and can trigger again if Ranger is healed above half HP and then falls below the threshold again. It is extremely powerful early game and secures Ranger as the best tank early game. It can even tank Magical attacks decently as Block will reduce Magical damage as well. Lanky Spanky does not have a Mas scaling to it, which is not a bad thing considering Ranger's low Mas. Stack increase is actually duration increase here, which can buy valuable time for your units to deal with threathening enemies. Stun in this game is not as mighty as other iterations as it does not stop the stunned unit from countering enemy attacks, but is still useful to stop them from attacking you during enemy phase. Command Orangutan is a standard Hunter class Red skill which is essentially a normal attack with an extra skill damage and effect attached. Exhaustion is just an ok debuff, but does help against dodgy enemies like Rogue, Witch or Sellsword. Mana cost down and increased stacks are all nice bonuses, but the healing is the more useful upgrade here, as Ranger is a tank unit with no healing outside of this. Healing will not only increase the longevity of Ranger, but can also bring Ranger above half HP threshold to potentially trigger its passive again.",
    "Tips": "Ranger is a tank class that can also deal good damage back. It is one of best tanks early game and can reliably ward off enemies when the situation arises. However, Ranger's effectiveness will start to decrease as the game progresses, earlier if difficulty is higher. This is due to its passive being static and its low Acc starts to catch up. Low Skill number also does not help as other units start to deal better damage with Skills. It is recommended to go into a tier 3 as soon as possible and use Ranger's skills as a support than stick to Ranger.",
    "Rings": "Ranger should focus on increasing its Bulk to tank better. Tranquility, Dauntless, Hollowed, Guardian, Indomitable and Dimming are all possible choices. Guardian is synergetic with Ranger's passive to give Ranger more Bulk when below half HP, and Dimming can remove Ranger's ineffective Mas stat to provide further boost to defenses, though due to Ranger's low Mas, the boost will be small. ",
    "Weapons": "",
    "Class": "Ranger naturally progresses into Warden, which is also the most synergetic tier 3 class for Ranger. Warden is a tank class with better stats and another passive than further boosts Def, picking up in terms of Bulk while Ranger alone is falling off. Ranger's overall skill effects are not impressive, and thus is generally not considered if Warden is not the tier 3 class of choice."

In terms of growth, Cutthroat has bad HP, Mgt and Frt growth modifier, as well as atrocious Def, but it excels in Spd, Dex and Lck, and has ok Mas growth. Cutthroat is very obvious a fast dodge tank, having good Ddg BEFORE counting in its passive, patching up its relatively low Bulk, and has no trouble doubling most enemies. It also has very high Crt with decent Acc, which can patch up its low Pwr dealing low damage per attack. Its only real weakness is its relatively low Skill Num, but it does not stop Cutthroat from being one of the best tier 2 classes.",
    "Character": "Amongst the four units capable of going into the Cutthroat class, Eve starts off as a Cutthroat. She is also the most aligned in terms of growth. Eve has the single highest Spd growth in the entire game as a Cutthroat, with insane Lck growth to boot. Her HP growth is actually not terrible either, but her defense are quite low. She also has low Mgt and Mas growth, which prevents her from being a perfect unit. Zanele is also quite fast as a Cutthroat, and slightly better growth in most other areas compared to Eve other than HP, most notable is her high Mas growth which Eve lacks. However, Zanele does suffer from a low Lck growth, which is anti-synergetic with Cutthroat's passive, making her not as compatible with the class compared to Eve. Tusk can be quite a fast and strong combatant as a Cutthroat, with his passive essentially providing more Spd. His Ddg is nowhere near as impressive as Eve's but with his monstrous HP and better Def it is not a bad combination. Lastly, Riordan has the best total growth, but will have a more balanced spread across the board. Cutthroat Riordan will not be a bad unit, but will be less ideal than the other specialists out there.",

    "Tips": "Cutthroat is a dodge tank, possibly the better form of tanker in this game compared to bulky tankers. Cutthroat is thus great in the front line and unlike Nightblade, deals better damage due to much higher Crt potential. You do need to look out for enemies with Precision and Trueseeing, they can be quite dangerous as Cutthroat's bulk without Ddg is very low.
