    "Details": "Wearer starts the chapter with 250 mana, instead of the usual 100. However, the wearer no longer regains 20 mana at the start of each turn. Other ways of gaining mana are not affected, like passive abilities, Charged ring or Empyrean rune. As units only start to generate mana on turn 2, and generates 20 per turn, Attuned ring lets the wearer to have more mana in total up until turn 8, only from turn 9 onwards (other than Arthur) would the ring actually start to affect the unit negatively.
